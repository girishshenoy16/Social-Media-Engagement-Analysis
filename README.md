## 🔍 **Key Features and Analysis Steps**

1. **Filtering**  
   - Select posts by platform (e.g., Twitter, Instagram, Facebook)
   - Filter posts by content type (Image, Video, Text)
   
2. **Sorting Metrics**  
   - Rank posts by: 
     - Views
     - Likes
     - Shares
     - Comments
     - Total Engagement
     - Engagement Rate
     - Virality Score

3. **Exploratory Analysis**  
   - Generate visualizations for engagement trends over time
   - Calculate distribution metrics
   - Detailed analysis available in `Analysis.ipynb`

4. **Predictive Modeling**  
   - Load pre-trained models:
     - **Engagement Model** (`models/engagement_model.pkl`) to forecast future post engagement metrics
     - **Virality Model** (`models/virality_model.pkl`) to classify posts as likely or unlikely to go viral
   - **Engagement Scaler** (`models/engagement_scaler.pkl`) and **Virality Scaler** (`models/virality_scaler.pkl`) are used to scale features to match the model's expectations.

5. **Export**  
   - Download filtered and predicted datasets as CSV
   - Export progress feedback included for transparency

## 🧠 **Predictive Models**

- **Engagement Model** (`models/engagement_model.pkl`):  
  - Predicts post engagement level (low, medium, or high) based on likes, shares, comments, and views.

- **Virality Model** (`models/virality_model.pkl`):  
  - Classifies whether a post is likely to go viral or not.

- **Engagement Scaler** (`models/engagement_scaler.pkl`):  
  - Scales input data (likes, shares, comments, views) for the engagement model.

- **Virality Scaler** (`models/virality_scaler.pkl`):  
  - Scales input data (likes, shares, comments, views) for the virality model.
